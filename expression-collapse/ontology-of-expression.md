# Expression as Quantum Collapse of the Wave Function of Images

## Abstract

This article proposes and substantiates the metaphor of expression as an act of quantum collapse of the wave function of images — a mental and pre-linguistic semantic field that includes potential, yet unarticulated forms of meaning, feeling, and intention. Contrary to the traditional view of thinking as logical or linguistic activity, it is argued here that expression is not a continuation of conscious choice but rather a reduction of rich pre-linguistic content into a limited field of symbolic articulation. The metaphor of a hash function is used to describe the irreversible and nondeterministic nature of this transition. Special attention is given to the distinction between consciousness and the observer: the former records the result but does not determine the choice; the latter is a condition of manifestation but is not identical to the subject. The article offers formalization of key concepts and lays the foundation for an ontology of expression, in which thought always lags behind what was already expressible but has become unuttered.

## I. Introduction

The act of expression — whether speech, writing, gesture, drawing, mathematical formula, or any other communicative act — is traditionally understood as a function of a conscious subject conveying some content to the external world or another person. In this approach, expression follows thought: first thought, then its expression.

This article proposes a different viewpoint: expression as a reduction of a potential semantic field, as an ontological collapse analogous in logic to the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics. Pre-linguistic thought is not a set of ready-made meanings waiting to be translated into words but rather a dynamic, multidimensional, and continuous state that can only be expressed through radical reduction — similar to how a multidimensional structure is encoded by a hash function into a short string of fixed length.

Expression is thus not a “channel” or “transmitting mechanism,” but rather an operation of reduction and fixation, irreversible and non-reproducible. It does not follow thought but generates conscious content as a result of folding, as a structure manifested in the observable form. Consciousness records this result but is not its source.

In this approach, the relationships between the following concepts need to be reconsidered:
- thought,
- image,
- expression,
- observer,
- consciousness,
- reduction,
- and the hash function as a philosophical metaphor.

The aim of this work is to construct an ontology of expression, where expression is regarded as a primary process generating the distinction between potential and actual, between multidimensional and articulated, between pre-conscious and manifested. We will show that in this context expression is not merely a means of communication but a fundamental mechanism of meaning manifestation.

## II. Formalization of Terms

### 1. Wave Function of Images (Ψ)

**Definition:**  
The wave function of images (Ψ) is a pre-reflexive state of semantic potentiality, preceding any act of thinking, perception, or differentiation. Ψ is not what we think or see, but the source from which thought, image, or form can be collapsed.

**Properties:**  
- Inaccessible to consciousness in its pure form;  
- Neither discrete nor quantized;  
- Does not obey the logic of identity (A ≠ A);  
- Characterized by intensities and tensions (in the spirit of Simondon and Deleuze);  
- Serves as the horizon of semantic potentiality.

**Remark:**  
Even minimally conscious thought (ϕ₁) is already the result of a collapse of Ψ, i.e., its reduction to a distinguishable form.

### 2. Act of Reduction and Levels of Collapse (Rᵢ: Ψ → ϕᵢ)

**Definition:**  
Reduction (Rᵢ) is an operation of manifestation, whereby from the pre-actual field (Ψ) a distinguishable form (ϕᵢ) arises. Each level of reduction (i) corresponds to a stage of concretization, manifestation, and medialization.

**Examples of levels:**  
- R₁(Ψ) = ϕ₁ — primary reduction: conscious image or thought;  
- R₂(ϕ₁) = φ — secondary reduction: speech, text, drawing, gesture (sign fixation);  
- R₃(φ) = E — expression fixed in a medium and accessible for interpretation by others.

**Consequences:**  
- Thought is already the result of collapse, not access to Ψ;  
- Even "experience" is reduced;  
- Dreams and altered states are variants of R with different operators.

### 3. Expression (E)

**Definition:**  
Expression (E) is the result of secondary or tertiary reduction, fixed in a medial medium (language, gesture, sound, image, etc.). It is not merely the transmission of meaning, but a reduction of reduction.

**Formally:**  
\[ E = h(C(\Psi_i)) \]  
where:  
- \( C \) — compositional or conceptual structure (\( \varphi \) or \( \phi \));  
- \( h \) — a hash function projecting the multidimensional into a constrained form.

**Properties:**  
- \( E \) is not a "copy" of \( \Psi \), but a compression;  
- Irreversible (h is non-invertible);  
- Subject to interpretations and collisions (different \( \Psi \) → similar \( E \)).

### 4. Reduction Hash Function (h)

**Definition:**  
The hash function (h) is a metaphor for the act of reduction, by which a complex, multidimensional structure of semantic potentiality is mapped into a limited, fixed expression space.

**Properties:**  
- **One-way:** it is impossible to reconstruct \( \Psi \) from \( E \);  
- **Collisions:** different \( \Psi \) can produce identical \( E \);  
- **Low resolution:** loss of semantic completeness.

### 5. Distinction Operator (O)

**Definition:**  
The distinction operator (O) is a logically necessary condition for the possibility of the collapse \( \Psi \to \varphi \). It does not produce distinction but makes it possible.

**Formally:**  
\[
\varphi_i = R_i O
\]

**What \( O \) is not:**  
- Not a subject, not an observer, not a psychic mechanism;  
- Not a structure, not localized in the brain, has no nature;  
- Does not act, choose, or exist in time.

**How to think about \( O \):**  
- A logical threshold of distinction, not a being;  
- An apophatic construct — cannot be positively defined;  
- A condition for the possibility of any actualization;  
- The boundary between the pre-ontological and the ontological.

### 6. Consciousness (S)

**Definition:**  
Consciousness ($S$) is the interface where the results of the reduction of $\Psi$ are fixed, but it is not the source of the reduction itself.
 
**Formally:**  
$S(R_i(\Psi)) = \text{mapping of } \varphi_i \text{ into subjective experience}$


**Remarks:**  

Consciousness is a screen, not a projector;  
Not an observer, but a zone of manifestation;  
Cannot "return" to $\Psi$, only fixes its collapses.

## III. Key Theses

1. **Thought is not the originating moment but merely the result of reduction.**  
   What we recognize as "thought," "experience," or "image" does not precede but rather follows the primary reduction ($R_1$) of the wave function of images ($\Psi$). Consciousness encounters not $\Psi$ itself, but $\varphi_1$ — an already collapsed form behind which lies an opaque depth of potentiality.

2. **$\Psi$ cannot be directly observed.**  
   The wave function of images is neither an object, nor a structure, nor a set. It is a pre-differentiated field of potential meaning formation. It is inaccessible in its pure form because its nature is pre-actuality. We cannot "think" $\Psi$ because thought itself is already a collapse, a differentiated form.

3. **Awareness is not a transparent access to the foundation.**  
   Even the "purest" conscious content is the result of an already occurred reduction. The differentiated $\neq$ the original. There is no "clean gaze" or neutral observational position in which $\Psi$ would manifest without distortion.

4. **Language and expression do not transmit thought but constitute it as formed.**  
   What we call an "utterance" is not a simple translation of thought into words. It is already the result of a secondary reduction ($R_2$), the imposition of expressibility structure on the reduced image. Expression is not the revelation of $\Psi$ but a reduction of a reduction:
   
$$
\phi = R_2(\varphi_1)
$$
   
   analogous to a hash function.

6. **The hash function is not merely a metaphor but a structural analogue.**  
   Expression fixes a finite representation from a far richer semantic field. Like a cryptographic hash function, expression is irreversible and limited. It does not allow reconstructing the original $\Psi$ and admits collisions: different $\Psi$ may yield similar $\phi$.

7. **Language ambiguity is not its weakness but an ontological feature.**  
   The polysemy of any utterance is not due to negligence or imperfection of language. It results from the fact that expression arises as a reduced projection of a denser and unstructured semantic space. The finite cannot exhaust the potential.

# IV. Diachrony and Multiplicity of Expression

1. **Repeated reduction is possible but not identical.**  
   Re-expressing the same wave function $\Psi_i$ is possible, but it always yields a different result. Even if the source $\Psi_i$ is preserved, its collapse may occur differently depending on conditions, operators, and formats.  
   Formally:  
   $$
   \Psi_i \to C_1 \to E_1
   $$
   $$
   \Psi_i \to C_2 \to E_2
   $$
   $$
   \Psi_i \to C_3 \to E_3
   $$
   and so on.

2. **Multiplicity of media = multiplicity of expressions.**  
   The same pre-reflexive wave function $\Psi_i$ can be reduced into various media:  
   poetry, mathematics, bodily movement, visual art, sound.  
   Each of these expressions $E_k$ is not a "translation" of the same content but its unique manifestation.

3. **Impossibility of exact reproducibility.**  
   Since reduction is not an invertible function, the attempt to "say the same thing in different words" leads to a new reduced state.  
   Even with apparent reproducibility of form, the collapse happens anew:  
   each time — a new $\varphi_k$.

4. **Interpretation as an additional reduction.**  
   Perception of the utterance by another consciousness $S'$ also initiates a new act of reduction:  
   $$
   \varphi_k \ (\text{expression}) \to R'(\varphi_k) = \varphi'
   $$  
   Thus, every act of understanding is not "access to the same," but a reduction of the result of collapse by another operator of distinction in a different context.

5. **The medium shapes but does not cause the collapse.**  
   Different forms of mediality — language, poetry, sound, drawing, bodily movement — do not initiate the reduction of $\Psi$, but participate in shaping the already distinguished content.  
   The medium is a channel for transmitting meaning, a way of its manifestation: it does not influence the act of distinction but determines the form of the final expression $\varphi_k$.  
   The collapse  
   $$
   \Psi_i \to \varphi_j
   $$  
   occurs before the choice of medium, but the medium shapes $\varphi_j$ into a specific form $\phi_k$.  
   Thus, the medium is not an operator of reduction, but an operator of form.
