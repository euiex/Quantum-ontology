# Expression as Quantum Collapse of the Wave Function of Images

## Abstract

This article proposes and substantiates the metaphor of expression as an act of quantum collapse of the wave function of images â€” a mental and pre-linguistic semantic field that includes potential, yet unarticulated forms of meaning, feeling, and intention. Contrary to the traditional view of thinking as logical or linguistic activity, it is argued here that expression is not a continuation of conscious choice but rather a reduction of rich pre-linguistic content into a limited field of symbolic articulation. The metaphor of a hash function is used to describe the irreversible and nondeterministic nature of this transition. Special attention is given to the distinction between consciousness and the observer: the former records the result but does not determine the choice; the latter is a condition of manifestation but is not identical to the subject. The article offers formalization of key concepts and lays the foundation for an ontology of expression, in which thought always lags behind what was already expressible but has become unuttered.
