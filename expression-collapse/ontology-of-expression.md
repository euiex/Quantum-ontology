# Expression as Quantum Collapse of the Wave Function of Images

## Abstract

This article proposes and substantiates the metaphor of expression as an act of quantum collapse of the wave function of images — a mental and pre-linguistic semantic field that includes potential, yet unarticulated forms of meaning, feeling, and intention. Contrary to the traditional view of thinking as logical or linguistic activity, it is argued here that expression is not a continuation of conscious choice but rather a reduction of rich pre-linguistic content into a limited field of symbolic articulation. The metaphor of a hash function is used to describe the irreversible and nondeterministic nature of this transition. Special attention is given to the distinction between consciousness and the observer: the former records the result but does not determine the choice; the latter is a condition of manifestation but is not identical to the subject. The article offers formalization of key concepts and lays the foundation for an ontology of expression, in which thought always lags behind what was already expressible but has become unuttered.

## I. Introduction

The act of expression — whether speech, writing, gesture, drawing, mathematical formula, or any other communicative act — is traditionally understood as a function of a conscious subject conveying some content to the external world or another person. In this approach, expression follows thought: first thought, then its expression.

This article proposes a different viewpoint: expression as a reduction of a potential semantic field, as an ontological collapse analogous in logic to the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics. Pre-linguistic thought is not a set of ready-made meanings waiting to be translated into words but rather a dynamic, multidimensional, and continuous state that can only be expressed through radical reduction — similar to how a multidimensional structure is encoded by a hash function into a short string of fixed length.

Expression is thus not a “channel” or “transmitting mechanism,” but rather an operation of reduction and fixation, irreversible and non-reproducible. It does not follow thought but generates conscious content as a result of folding, as a structure manifested in the observable form. Consciousness records this result but is not its source.

In this approach, the relationships between the following concepts need to be reconsidered:
- thought,
- image,
- expression,
- observer,
- consciousness,
- reduction,
- and the hash function as a philosophical metaphor.

The aim of this work is to construct an ontology of expression, where expression is regarded as a primary process generating the distinction between potential and actual, between multidimensional and articulated, between pre-conscious and manifested. We will show that in this context expression is not merely a means of communication but a fundamental mechanism of meaning manifestation.
